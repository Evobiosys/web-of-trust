/**
 * A state saved by a build of the demo before Profile/InventoryItem existed
 * has neither field on disk. Every reader added in this change (screenHome's
 * `s.inventory.length`, threadsInScope's `s.inventory.map`, screenProfile's
 * `s.profile.*`) assumes both are present. Without normalization, opening
 * the app on a phone that already ran an earlier build throws mid-render --
 * or, worse, mid-consent-ceremony inside runConsentCeremony -- rather than
 * during boot where bootFailed() could at least say why.
 *
 * This writes a legacy-shaped record straight to the kv store (bypassing
 * state.ts's own in-memory `cached` var, which would otherwise just hand
 * back whatever object a same-process saveState() had cached, never
 * exercising loadState()'s normalization at all) and proves loadState()
 * fills in both fields before anything else touches the result.
