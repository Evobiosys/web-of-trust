/**
 * demo 21 (secondHop scenario, DEVLOG/handover-demo21-two-hop.md): the
 * three-device, live-relay end-to-end test the handover asks for --
 * "the exact way test/e2e/call_into_the_web.mjs proves the one-hop case:
 * compare actual wire bytes, not just screen text."
 *
 * Runs the ACTUAL modules main.ts's relay ceremony calls -- gate.ts
 * (decide/maskAnswerPlaintext/truncateSharedJson/sealAnswerEnvelope),
 * match/lexical.ts, data/free_text_query.ts, state.ts -- directly in Node
 * against the LIVE relay at questhub.eco, same style as
 * call_into_the_web.mjs. The ceremony ORCHESTRATION (main.ts's
 * runSecondHopRelayCeremony/forwardToOwner/sendSecondHopFinalAnswer) is not
 * importable here (main.ts is DOM-bound), so this script reproduces its
 * exact sequence of calls into the real modules -- the same relationship
 * call_into_the_web.mjs already has to handleAmbientQuery's own logic.
 *
 * Cast, re-enacting verification/alpha-run.txt leg (g) (Bob asks -> Alice
 * relays her note about Carol's ladder -> two-hop consent -> Bob connected
 * to Carol) one layer up, in apps/demo's own browser-facing protocol:
 *   Jakob -- the laptop. Has a real inventory entry: a 3m ladder.
 *   A     -- paired to Jakob. Has NOTHING of her own, but a private
 *            second-brain note: "Jakob has a ladder."
 *   B     -- paired to A only. Has never met Jakob, does not know he exists
 *            except through this note firing.
 *
 * Legs:
 *   (1) SUCCESS: B asks about a ladder -> A has no direct match -> A's note
 *       matches -> A forwards to Jakob (relayed: true) -> Jakob matches his
 *       own inventory and consents, naming himself -> A relays the named
 *       answer back to B.
 *   (2) A DECLINES TO RELAY: same question, A's note matches, A chooses not
 *       to forward. No wire traffic to Jakob at all for this leg.
 *   (3) JAKOB DECLINES: A forwards, Jakob's own device has the ladder but
 *       he taps "no".
 *   (4) JAKOB HAS NOTHING: A forwards a DIFFERENT question Jakob's own
 *       inventory does not match.
 *   (5) DEPTH CAP: B's query already carries `relayed: true` (simulating an
 *       attempt to pre-relay). A's note would otherwise match, but the I8
 *       guard (`!q.relayed`) must fold this into an ordinary no-match with
 *       NO wire traffic to Jakob at all.
 *   (6) GENUINE NO MATCH: an unrelated question, no note, no relay
 *       eligible, ordinary "nothing".
 *   (7) SAME QID, TWICE: (2) and (3) re-run against one pinned qid, both
 *       over the live relay, to pin the STRICT ciphertext-byte-identity
 *       claim against real network bytes (legs 2-6 each use their own
 *       fresh qid, which is realistic but means AES-GCM's
 *       deterministic-IV-from-qid scheme makes their raw ciphertext differ
 *       even though the plaintext underneath is identical -- see THE PROOF
 *       below for why that is not a gap).
 *   (8) TIMING WIRING (the fixed-at-receipt dispatch pattern): legs 1-7
 *       above prove CONTENT byte-identity but never exercised the deadline
 *       itself -- an earlier version of main.ts's ceremony called
 *       `settleAt(receivedAt, RELAY_DEADLINE_MS)` from INSIDE each ending,
 *       AFTER a human had already decided; `settleAt` resolves immediately
 *       once its target instant has already passed (gate.ts's own doc
 *       comment says so), so any ending reached after a human took longer
 *       than the window fired EARLY, at whatever moment the human acted --
 *       turning B's own received-at timestamp into a hop-count oracle. The
 *       fix (main.ts's `createRelayDispatch`) arms ONE timer at RECEIPT,
 *       before any human interaction, and a `resolve()` call only ever
 *       updates what will be sent when that timer fires -- a resolve that
 *       arrives after the timer already fired is simply too late. This leg
 *       reproduces that exact pattern (with a short LOCAL deadline, not the
 *       real 30s constant -- already pinned separately by
 *       test/second_hop_timing.test.ts's fake-timer test -- to keep this
 *       live run fast) against the real relay, twice: once with an
 *       immediate resolve (must still wait for the deadline, not fire
 *       early) and once with a resolve deliberately delayed PAST the
 *       deadline (must already have sent "nothing" by then, with the late
 *       resolve producing no second message).
 *
 * THE PROOF: legs (2)-(6) must all decrypt, under the real live A<->B pair
 * key, to the IDENTICAL all-zero plaintext, despite five structurally
 * different causes -- one of them (leg 3/4) involving a real second device
 * a full network round trip away, on a device B has never heard of. Leg (7)
 * additionally proves the stricter, wire-level claim (byte-identical
 * ciphertext, not just identical plaintext) against two of those causes at
 * a single fixed qid, over the live relay both times -- the same claim
 * test/second_hop_gate.test.ts proves as a pure function, now proven
 * end to end. Leg (1) must differ from all of them and must carry Jakob's
 * true name, verbatim, to B.
 *
 * Run with tsx:
 *
 *   cd apps/demo && npx tsx test/e2e/second_hop.mjs
