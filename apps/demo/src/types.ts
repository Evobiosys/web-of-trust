 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It records what THIS device was asked and what THIS
 * device decided -- nothing about any other device, ever, because there is
 * nothing here that could name one: a query only ever names its own asker
 * (`fromDisplayName`/`fromId`), the one thing this device already legitimately
 * knows per I4 (contextual consent: the owner sees asker identity + request
 * text before deciding anything). Logging it locally does not teach the
 * asker, or any other peer, anything they could not already have caused this
 * device to know.
 *
 * `outcome` reuses LocalOutcome verbatim on purpose (see that type's doc
 * comment: "Reasons live only on the answering device. They are never
 * serialised."). A log entry MUST NEVER be built from, or fed into, anything
 * that crosses the wire -- gate.ts's AnswerEnvelope has no field for it and
 * never will (test/gate_identity.test.ts pins AnswerEnvelope's shape shut).
 * main.ts's emitAnswer() appends the log entry (via answer_log.ts's
 * logAndDispatch()) BEFORE the answer is sent (or shown as a QR) -- not
 * after. The entry's own cost still cannot shift when the wire message goes
 * out (a plain array push is O(1) and identical regardless of `outcome`),
 * but its EXISTENCE must not depend on that send ever completing: relay.ts's
 * ingress POST has no timeout, and a query this device answers ambiently and
 * silently has nobody watching a screen to notice a stalled send -- only the
 * local record would ever have shown it happened at all. See answer_log.ts's
 * module doc comment for the full argument.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT stored: `match.hits` themselves. Only the label
 * (`outcome`) is kept, never the matched content. Two reasons: it keeps every
 * entry the same shape/size regardless of how many hits fired (no local
 * signal that could vary by outcome the way the wire's byte-padding already
 * guards against), and it means this log is not a second place chat content
 * ends up retained -- "was ich habe"/imported chats remain the one copy.
