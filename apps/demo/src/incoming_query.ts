/**
 * The one decision that separates "this device shows something" from "this
 * device shows nothing" for a query that arrived AMBIENTLY -- over an
 * already-open relay/webrtc channel, with nobody having chosen to scan
 * anything (main.ts's handleAmbientQuery is the only caller). A manual QR
 * scan (screenAnswer's "Frage scannen" button, demo 1's whole flow) is a
 * different, inherently interactive path this function does not gate: a
 * person who just tapped "scan a query" has already chosen to look, so
 * showing them the consent ceremony regardless of match is not an
 * interruption in the sense this module cares about. See
 * runConsentCeremony's doc comment in main.ts.
 *
 * Deliberately pure and DOM-free, in its own module rather than folded into
 * main.ts, for exactly one reason: it must be the SAME function the app
 * calls and the acceptance test asserts on. A test that recomputes
 * `match.aboveThreshold` itself is testing a proxy for the app's decision,
 * not the decision -- a bug where the silent path still renders (e.g. a
 * send helper that calls shell() on success) would leave such a test green
 * while the demo visibly breaks. Importing this function is what closes
 * that gap.
