/**
 * THE central privacy contract of the demo.
 *
 * B asks A a templated question. A's device matches locally. A is asked only
 * "are you willing to share what you have? yes / no". B must learn EXACTLY
 * ONE BIT: `shared` or `nothing`.
 *
 * Four internal reasons collapse to `nothing`: `no-match`, `below-k`,
 * `declined`, `blocked`. Those four MUST be indistinguishable to B --
 * byte-identical envelopes and indistinguishable timing. See
 * test/gate_identity.test.ts and test/gate_timing.test.ts, which enforce
 * exactly this.
 *
 * How byte-identity is achieved (read this before changing anything below):
 *
 *  1. Every path builds a plaintext buffer of EXACTLY ANSWER_BODY_LEN bytes,
 *     unconditionally, using the SAME construction:
 *       [0]        tag byte: 0x00 = nothing, 0x01 = shared
 *       [1..3)     big-endian uint16: length of the JSON payload (0 if none)
 *       [3..3+n)   UTF-8 JSON of the (possibly truncated) SharedPayload
 *       [3+n..end) padding
 *  2. The "what would we share" JSON is built from `match.hits` on EVERY
 *     call, regardless of `blocked`/`consent`/`aboveThreshold`. This is the
 *     part that closes the timing side channel: if we only serialised the
 *     payload when actually sharing, `below-k` (many hits, but under
 *     threshold) would be cheaper than `shared` (many hits) purely because
 *     of when the JSON work happens, and `no-match` (zero hits) would be
 *     cheaper still. Doing the work every time makes CPU cost a function of
 *     `match.hits.length` alone, not of the outcome.
 *  3. The final plaintext is chosen from the two fully-built candidates
 *     (`sharedPlain`, `nothingPlain`) with a byte-wise mask, not an
 *     `if (outcome === 'shared') {...} else {...}` on the buffer itself.
 *     There is exactly one boolean branch in this file that affects plaintext
 *     content (`wouldShare`), and all four `nothing` reasons evaluate it
 *     identically to `false` -- they never branch against EACH OTHER.
 *  4. AES-GCM is deterministic for a fixed (key, iv, plaintext) triple. Fixed
 *     key + fixed iv + byte-identical plaintext therefore gives byte-identical
 *     ciphertext, by construction, not by hoping the test never catches a
 *     divergence.

 * GATE_BUDGET_MS, the trip back) -- not just decide()'s CPU cost the way
 * GATE_BUDGET_MS above equalises for every other demo.
 *
 * Why this exists at all, and why it is not just a bigger GATE_BUDGET_MS:
 * a relay hop has FIVE reasons to end up sending B nothing (A has no note,
 * A declines to relay, Jakob declines, Jakob has nothing, Jakob never
 * answers in time) and each one resolves at a wildly different point in
 * time -- some near-instantly (no note at all), some only after a second
 * human, on a second device, has looked at a prompt and tapped. If A sent
 * the moment ITS OWN decision was final, the fast cases and the slow cases
 * would arrive at B seconds apart and the gap itself would tell B which
 * kind of "nothing" it was -- exactly the failure this project's I3 exists
 * to rule out, one hop further than gate.ts's own byte-identity mechanism
 * reaches on its own. See main.ts's relay ceremony: it computes its OWN
 * content (`maskAnswerPlaintext`/`truncateSharedJson`) at FIRE time, at
 * `t0 + RELAY_DEADLINE_MS`, exactly the same discipline
 * `packages/agent-daemon`'s `dispatchOwnerStatus` already uses for its own
 * single uniform STATUS dispatch (`statusDispatchAt`) -- content computed
 * when the timer fires, never when the underlying decision became known.
 *
 * The value itself is not invented for this demo: I3's own stated default
 * ("byte-identical PASS wire messages on a uniform reply schedule, default
 * 30 s, no jitter" -- this repo's own CLAUDE.md) is reused verbatim rather
 * than picking a new number with no prior standing in this project. A live
 * demo operator should have Jakob's phone already unlocked and in hand
 * before B asks -- see DEVLOG/result-report-demo21.md's presenter note.
 * `settleAt` (below) already resolves immediately if this instant has
 * already passed, so a genuinely slow relay round-trip that overruns this
 * window is handled the same way D15 handles a late downstream CONSENT:
 * B already has its answer (nothing, sent right at the deadline); a late
 * arrival from Jakob after that point is recorded locally (I6) and never
 * given a second message to B (see main.ts's relay ceremony doc comment).
