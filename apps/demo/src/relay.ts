/**
 * relay.ts -- the demo's network path.
 *
 * Two already-paired devices (Marlene, Nora -- see state.ts) exchange the
 * existing QueryEnvelope/AnswerEnvelope wire (wire.ts) through the LIVE
 * store-and-forward relay at questhub.eco
 * (packages/transport/src/relay_server.ts): `POST /relay/send` to submit,
 * `wss://.../relay/drain` to receive, Ed25519-authenticated by the did:peer:2
 * identity minted in did.ts.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES, PRECISELY (read before reusing this claim anywhere):
 * the relay routes on the outer `to` field ONLY -- see relay_server.ts's file
 * header, "the ciphertext is never touched, never decrypted". The payload it
 * carries is AES-GCM ciphertext under the pair key the QR ceremony already
 * derived (crypto.ts#derivePairKey), which the relay never saw and cannot
 * derive. So: the relay learns who is talking to whom and when (traffic
 * metadata), and carries only ciphertext.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** PROVE: `derivePairKey` is explicitly NOT an
 * authenticated key exchange (see crypto.ts's SECURITY NOTE) -- anyone who
 * saw both QR codes during the pairing ceremony can compute the same pair
 * key and therefore decrypt everything this module sends. This module's
 * job is carrying that already-established (and already-limited) trust
 * across a network hop without the relay operator being able to read it.
 * Do not describe any of this as secure end to end -- it is not an
 * authenticated channel, only an unreadable-to-the-relay one.
 *
 * CORS: the relay sends NO CORS headers on its ingress
 * (`POST /relay/send`), so that fetch() call only succeeds when this page
 * is served FROM the relay's own origin (questhub.eco in production) --
 * see resolveRelayOrigin() below. The `wss://.../relay/drain` WebSocket
 * handshake is NOT subject to CORS (the same-origin policy for XHR/fetch
 * does not apply to the WebSocket protocol), so the drain connection works
 * cross-origin regardless; only `send()`'s POST is origin-locked.
 *
 * SCOPE: `onEnvelope` accepts EITHER a single fixed `CryptoKey` (demos
 * 1/2/3/6's shape, unchanged: "a later call replaces the earlier one",
 * correct for a demo that pairs exactly one asker with one holder at a
 * time) OR a `PairKeyResolver` function that picks a key per inbound wire
 * from its cleartext `from` DID -- added for demo 20 (mode.ts's
 * `wotScenario() === 'geologengasse'`), where one laptop holds several
 * peers at once and each needs its OWN pair key to decrypt. Passing a plain
 * `CryptoKey` is exactly equivalent to passing `() => thatKey`: every
 * inbound wire is tried against it regardless of sender, byte-identically
 * to this file's behaviour before `PairKeyResolver` existed. `send()` takes
 * the pair key explicitly per call, as before -- it was never
 * single-peer-limited; only the receive side (`onEnvelope`'s single `sink`)
 * was.
 *
 * `sendRaw`/`onRawWire` are a second, DELIBERATELY UNENCRYPTED path,
 * scoped to exactly one caller: the one-scan connect-link ceremony's
 * bootstrap message (connect_link.ts), sent before either side can derive
 * a shared key at all. Nothing else in this app should ever call them --
 * see connect_link.ts's module header for why that one case is safe and
 * every other message stays on the encrypted `send`/`onEnvelope` path.
