/**
 * "Ins Netzwerk rufen" ("call into the web"): a free-text ask, as opposed to
 * one of the five fixed TEMPLATES (data/templates.ts). B types a sentence
 * instead of picking a card; A's device matches it with the exact same
 * matcher (match/lexical.ts's matchTemplate), because this builds an ordinary
 * QueryTemplate from the free text -- there is no second matching path.
 *
 * Why a synthetic QueryTemplate rather than a new matcher entry point: every
 * caller on the answering side (runConsentCeremony, the ambient query
 * handler, gate.ts's decide()) already takes a QueryTemplate and never checks
 * where it came from. Reusing that contract means a free-text ask is, from
 * the matcher and the gate onward, indistinguishable in shape from a fixed
 * template -- the SAME anonymity floor, the SAME exclude-term veto machinery
 * (empty here, but the field exists so nothing has to special-case it), the
 * SAME byte-identical-PASS discipline.
