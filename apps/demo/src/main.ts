 * `peers[0]` -- "the query goes to every connected peer, not just the

 * addressing `peers[0]` only: a single already-open data channel or a QR
 * code only ever reaches one peer regardless of how many are paired.
 *
 * Demo 20 (geologengasse) is INCLUDED as of the browser pass this comment's
 * earlier version asked for: the whole scenario is several friends asking
 * Jakob for things, so excluding the one device that routinely holds several
 * peers excluded the point. Jakob's laptop is the one place in
 * this app that already legitimately holds several relay peers today (each
 * accepted guest, via acceptPendingRequest()), so `relayPeers.length > 1` is
 * routinely true there -- but demo 20 is live and being demonstrated the day
 * this branch landed, and askNetwork()/screenNetworkResult() have not yet
 * been exercised in a browser (only against the live relay directly, no
 * DOM). Rather than risk an untested code path on running software, Jakob's
 * "Fragen" keeps its exact existing single-peer askOverRelay behaviour --
 * this is a narrowing, not a new capability, so it cannot regress what demo
 * 20 already does. The exclusion has now been lifted and demo 20's ask path
 * verified in a browser against the live relay.

 * human, somewhere, was involved). Arming the timer here, once, before any
 * human interaction can happen, removes that: `resolve()` only ever updates
 * what WILL be sent when the timer fires; it never itself triggers a send,
 * and a `resolve()` that arrives after the timer already fired is simply
