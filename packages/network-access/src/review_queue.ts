// Owner-review UI (demo/review.html) presentation layer. Pure functions only:
// this module has NO gating authority — it reads the already-computed state
// that gates.ts/query_gateway.ts/red_flags.ts produce and arranges it into
// "what does the owner need to look at, and what can they tap." It never
// decides whether a query may run or what an Approve tap actually does on
// the wire — demo/server.ts still calls applyEvent()/submitQuery() etc. for
// that, exactly as it does for the existing inbox.html.
//
// Two things live here because they're genuinely reusable, testable logic
// independent of any one page: which of an incoming query's next actions is
// "the one big Approve button" for its current gate state (deriving that
// from IntroQuery.state — never inventing a state the machine doesn't have),
// and a staleness/season marker for "dates everywhere" (memo item 5).
