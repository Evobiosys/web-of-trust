// RelayClient — the browser-held self-sovereign identity's DIDComm relay
// client (QR-onboarding Task 3). A browser identity has no HTTP endpoint of
// its own (nothing can POST to it directly), so it can only send/receive via
// a trust-graph relay/mediator (packages/transport/src/relay_server.ts):
//   send()      — POST an already-packed wire to the relay's ingress.
//   onInbound() — drain an authenticated WebSocket for wires addressed to
//                 this identity's DID.
//
// REUSE DECISION: this ports packages/transport/src/relay_channel.ts's
// client-side protocol logic, NOT an import of it — same rationale as
// identity.ts/didcomm_crypto.ts's REUSE DECISIONs: relay_channel.ts imports
// `WebSocket` from `ws` (node-only) and its package pulls in `matrix-bot-sdk`
// transitively via the barrel. The wire-level PROTOCOL below (submit
// response shape, nonce -> Ed25519-sign -> auth handshake, wire/ack framing)
// is identical to relay_channel.ts's, so this client interoperates with the
// same live RelayServer transport's daemon talks to.
//
// WEBSOCKET API CHOICE: relay_channel.ts's DrainConnection is written against
// `ws`'s Node-EventEmitter API (`.on("message", data)`, `.terminate()`).
// That API does NOT exist on the browser's native WebSocket. This file is
// written against the DOM WebSocket interface instead
// (`addEventListener`/`close()`), which is the intersection both the native
// browser WebSocket AND `ws`'s WebSocket (v8+ implements addEventListener
// and delivers a MessageEvent-shaped `{data}`) support — so the exact same
// code drains a live relay whether run in a real browser (native
// `globalThis.WebSocket`) or under a Node test harness (an injected `ws`
// WebSocket via `wsCtor`).
//
// CRYPTO: send() calls this package's own didcomm_crypto.ts#packMessage
// (browser-safe port of transport's, see that file's header) to sign-then-
// encrypt the outgoing envelope; onInbound() calls its unpackMessage to
// decrypt-then-verify (signature + from-binding) every drained wire. The
// relay itself never decrypts anything — it only ever reads the outer `to`.
//
// AT-LEAST-ONCE: the relay may redeliver an unacked wire on reconnect (see
// relay_server.ts's file header). This client acks a wire's queue id right
// after handing it to the callback (success OR failure — a wire that fails
// to unpack is acked too, so a poisoned/malformed wire cannot wedge the
// queue and redeliver forever) but keeps NO local dedup of its own: a
// caller that needs duplicate-suppression must dedup on the delivered
// message's signed `id`, never by content (per the task brief).
