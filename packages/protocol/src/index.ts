// @resource-web/protocol — v0.1 frozen protocol package.
// Zero runtime dependencies besides zod; no I/O; no transport imports (I5 swappability).
// D14 (additive, version string stays "0.1"): TrustEdge.level, the
// close/public SharePolicy audience tiers, and the LISTING/LOAN/DM envelope
// bodies all land via the wildcard re-exports below — no new export list
// needed here, schemas.ts/envelope.ts already own their own `export`s.
