// relay_only.ts — standalone mediator relay entrypoint (core-transport-plan.md
// Task 10's "one node runs relay_server" deployment shape), for hosting a
// single RelayServer as its own process on a server that is NOT also running
// an agent-daemon persona (unlike scripts/alpha_server.ts, which mounts a
// RelayServer onto one persona's own HTTP server via the additive
// `relayServer` extras hook).
//
// This is the process a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, ...) sits in front of.
// It intentionally binds to 127.0.0.1 only — the standalone deployment shape
// assumes a TLS-terminating proxy in front, never direct internet exposure of
// the raw HTTP+WS port. See relay_server.ts's `listen()` doc comment: ingress
// is unauthenticated store-and-forward, so the size/queue caps (already
// enforced inside RelayServer) are the only thing standing between an open
// port and abuse — keep this behind a proxy that at minimum provides TLS and
// (ideally) rate limiting.
//
// Config via env vars (kept to env, not CLI flags, so a systemd unit's
// `Environment=` lines are the single source of truth):
//   RELAY_PORT      - TCP port to listen on (default 4177).
//   RELAY_HOST      - bind address (default 127.0.0.1 — see above).
//   RELAY_QUEUE_DB  - path to the SQLite queue file (default
//                     "<cwd>/queue.db"; pass an absolute path in production).
//
// Deliberately uses RelayServer's DEFAULT ingress/drain paths (/relay/send,
// /relay/drain) rather than any custom prefix: alpha_server.ts's meet-card
// wiring (`relay_url: new URL(mediatorEndpoint).origin`) and mobile-ui's
// connect-flow (`relay=<mediator base origin>`, see
// apps/mobile-ui/src/screens/connect_flow.js) both resolve a relay to just
// its base ORIGIN and always append the default paths themselves — a relay
// mounted under a URL path prefix would be unreachable to any card/QR
// discovered peer even if a hand-configured RelayChannel could be pointed at
// it via custom ingressPath/drainPath. So the proxy in front of this process
// MUST map the relay's origin root (or at least handle
// "/relay/*" unprefixed) straight to this port — not a sub-path that strips
// or rewrites away from "/relay/send" + "/relay/drain".
