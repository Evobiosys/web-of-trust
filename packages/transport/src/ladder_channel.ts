// LadderChannel — ordered fallback composition of DeliveryChannel rungs
// (core-transport-plan.md §0 SCOPE REVISION + Task 3, simplified to "T3'").
//
// SCOPE: per §0, WebRTC / mediator-less direct P2P is DEFERRED. There is no
// "webrtc" rung and no signaling plane here — this ladder has exactly one
// data plane with two rungs, tried in the order the caller supplies them:
//
//   (b) relay      — RelayChannel, a trust-graph mediator (Task 7).
//   (c) lan_http    — HttpPostChannel, the LAN HTTP floor (Task 1).
//
// LadderChannel is itself just another DeliveryChannel (composable, and in
// particular usable as DidCommTransport's `opts.channel`): `deliver()` tries
// each configured rung in order, advancing to the next on that rung's
// failure or timeout, and rejects only once every rung has failed.
// `onInbound(cb)` registers the SAME callback on every rung, so inbound wires
// from any rung funnel into the one shared sink DidCommTransport wires to its
// (unchanged) receiveInbound() — this file never decrypts or dispatches
// anything itself (core-transport-plan.md §1 rule 1).
//
// Failure detection per rung (documented + tested in ladder_channel.test.ts):
//   - relay:    the rung's own channel.deliver() rejects (relay unreachable,
//               every configured relay endpoint rejected the wire, or no
//               relay node known for the peer — see relay_channel.ts), OR
//               the rung does not settle within `budgets.relayAckMs` (when
//               configured) — LadderChannel races the call against that
//               budget itself, on top of whatever internal ack-timeout the
//               RelayChannel already applies per endpoint.
//   - lan_http: the rung's own channel.deliver() rejects (POST non-2xx, or a
//               socket-level failure — see delivery_channel.ts's
//               defaultHttpPost), OR it does not settle within
//               `budgets.httpMs` (when configured).
//
// Cross-rung duplicate delivery of the same signed message id (e.g. a sender
// whose relay rung succeeded but who also happens to be reachable directly)
// is intentionally NOT deduped here — DidCommTransport's DedupStore (Task 2)
// is the single place that absorbs any resulting duplicate, keyed on the
// cryptographically-authenticated message id. This file only ever fans the
// same wire to the same sink; it never inspects wire contents.
