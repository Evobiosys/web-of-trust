// RelayChannel — the CLIENT side of the trust-graph relay/mediator server
// (core-transport-plan.md Task 7; counterpart to relay_server.ts's Task 6).
// This is rung "b" of the delivery ladder (see delivery_channel.ts's file
// header for the DeliveryChannel seam this implements).
//
// Two independent responsibilities, mirroring the server's ingress/drain
// split:
//
//   deliver(recipientDid, wire) — POST the already-packed wire (its outer
//   `to` field, set by didcomm_crypto.ts's packMessage, already carries the
//   recipient DID; `recipientDid` here is not re-embedded into the request,
//   it is the DeliveryChannel contract's parameter) to a known relay's
//   ingress endpoint (`POST {endpoint}/relay/send`, RelayServer's default
//   ingress path). The relay's `submit()` responds SYNCHRONOUSLY with a
//   SubmitResult ({routed: "live"|"queued"|"rejected"}) in the same HTTP
//   response — that response IS "the relay's delivery-ack" for this
//   protocol; there is no separate async ack a submitter waits on (the WS
//   `ack` frame is recipient -> relay, for queue dequeue, an unrelated
//   concept). `routed !== "rejected"` resolves; a 404/rejected response, a
//   request timeout, or an unreachable endpoint all count as that endpoint
//   failing, and the next configured endpoint is tried. Only once every
//   configured endpoint has failed does deliver() reject (so a LadderChannel
//   caller can fall back to the next rung, e.g. rung "c" LAN HTTP).
//
//   onInbound(cb) — open an authenticated, long-lived drain WebSocket to
//   EVERY configured relay endpoint (not just the first): a peer may route a
//   message through ANY relay this identity advertises in its own meet-card
//   (Task 8's CardPayload.relays), so missing even one configured endpoint's
//   drain would silently drop mail. Each endpoint's connection independently
//   completes the nonce -> Ed25519-signature -> auth_ok handshake (proving
//   ownership of THIS identity's DID, matching relay_server.ts's 6b), then
//   feeds every "wire" frame verbatim to the shared callback and immediately
//   acks its id. RelayChannel keeps no local dedup of its own: at-least-once
//   delivery is inherent to the server's ack-to-dequeue contract (a wire
//   pushed to a socket that dies before its ack lands is redelivered on the
//   next authenticated drain), and DidCommTransport's message-id dedup
//   (dedup_store.ts / Task 2) is the single place that absorbs any resulting
//   duplicate. What this file DOES guarantee is that it never gratuitously
//   re-emits an already-acked wire: acking happens right after handing the
//   wire to the callback, so a clean reconnect only re-drains whatever the
//   relay still has queued (i.e. whatever never got acked).
//
// Reconnect: each endpoint's drain connection reconnects independently with
// capped exponential backoff on any drop (mirrors
// apps/mobile-ui/src/api_client_live.js's reconnect: 1s -> 2s -> 4s -> ...
// -> 15s, reset to the base on a successful re-auth).
